## Who are we?

The **Midwood Aerospace Group for Engineers (MAGE)** is a club at Midwood High School that focuses on aerospace and engineering. MAGE is a club for those who are interested in **science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)**. Members in MAGE will primarily learn engineering principles and applications in the 'real world'. They will also learn about aeronautics and participate in a fully functional **model rocket projects**.

## What is our goal?

MAGE is **ambitious** in its missions and goals. It offers a **unique experience** unlike any other for dedicated members who may decide to pursue engineering. There's **never** been a club like this in Midwood's history, making it particularly special. We aim to teach and serve midwood students to their rightful engineering education, which is heavily under served by Midwood High.
